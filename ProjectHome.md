Airfare ticketing system, into the system home page is divided into two parts: the user logs on or direct purchase. Already registered users can log in directly after the purchase, unregistered and registered users do not want to directly enter the booking process. Users log in, check the ticket to be purchased, simply choose the number of tickets can be completed. Registered users, queries to the ticket to be purchased, you need to fill out personal information such as names, identification numbers, ticket delivery address, etc., and then select the number to complete the purchase.
Managers, sales managers and users use the same login page to log in, then the background program to distinguish between the two, so that the administrator into the Account Management page, sales manager into the flight management and ticket management page, and users access to tickets page. This reduction in page development, streamlining the system structure, easy to maintain.
